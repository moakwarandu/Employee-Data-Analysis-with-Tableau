# WP Company Employee Data Analysis



## Introduction
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing employee information, potentially for a Human Resources department.  By understanding the data, the HR department can gain insights into employee demographics, work tenure, and other factors that might influence human resource decisions.

## Problem Statement
1. Are there any trends in hiring across departments?
2. What's the distribution of salaries across departments?
3. Are there any employees with exceptionally high or low hours worked?
4. Are there any correlations between years of experience and salary?

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Analysis With Tableau: Understanding and exploring the provided dataset.
- Data Transformation: Cleaning and shaping the data for Tableau.
- Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to represent the data visually.
- Tableau Desktop: Using Tableau to create interactive visualizations.

## Data Sourcing
The data for this project is a simple table containing employee information, including:

- Employee ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Division
- Department
- Date of Hire
- Benefit Code
- Possible Hours Worked
- Hourly Rate
- Gross Pay
- Full/Part Time indicator
- Year of Hire
- Month of Hire

## Data Transformation
- Removing duplicate entries
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types

## Modeling

No complex modeling is required for this basic visualization project.

## Analysis and Visualization
We can use Tableau Desktop to connect to the data and create visualizations to explore different aspects of the employee data. Here are some examples:

- Number of Employees by Department: A bar chart can show the number of employees in each department. This can help identify which departments have the most or least staff.

- Average Salary by Department: A bar chart can show the average salary for each department. This can help identify any pay disparities between departments.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
By using Tableau to visualize the employee data, we can gain valuable insights that can inform human resource decisions. For example, if the data shows that a particular department has a high turnover rate, HR might investigate the reasons for this and develop strategies to retain employees.
